  <p style="font-family: Courier  New; font-size: 18px;"> CHAPTER ONE – EPHRAM</p>

  <br />

  <p style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: 13px;"> They don’t yell “All aboard!” anymore. All are not permitted on the trains. Especially not the Midnight Train, or so they say.</p>

  <p style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: 13px;"> The air is heavy and wet as the platform fills; impatient, sweaty, heaving bodies crowding against one another in the dark as time ticks ever so slowly towards the end of this day and the start of the next. Some mutter to themselves —– enchantments beneath their breaths. Others send sparks into the air. Technicolour warnings to the competition: <i>you will not win</i>.</p>
