*SKELETON CREWS*
<br>
</p>  
<P>
There is a morbid freedom
<br>
in embracing this new reality.
<br>
A sense of relief,
<br>
in settling into chaos.
<br>
It's delicious, though
<br>
not pretty, to see
<br>
the world descend
<br>
into an inevitable fate.
</P>

<p>
Humanity has gone dark,
<br>
and the world mad.
<br>
The air has grown toxic,
<br>
but the Earth she thrives.
<br>
Flora blooms, water clears,
<br>
fauna rolls gleefully
<br>
in peaceful fields.
</p>

<p>
And so we pause.
<br>
And we honour silence.
</p>

<p>
Skeleton crews
<br>
in Spring.
</p>
