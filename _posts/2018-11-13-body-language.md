  <p>
*BODY LANGUAGE*
<br>
</p>

<P>
What do we do
<br>
when language isn't
<br>
enough?
<br>
When thoughts
<br>
become frozen,
<br>
and emotions
<br>
suffer motionless.
</P>

<p>
What do we do
<br>
when bodies scream
<br>
soundlessly?
<br>
When limbs
<br>
and lips ache.
</p>

<p>
Can't you hear
<br>
my whispers?
<br>
Why can't you?
</p>

<p>
What do we do
<br>
with these empty
<br>
spaces?
<br>
When they're not
<br>
empty at all.
<br>
I'd drown amongst
<br>
all the misunderstandings.
</p>

<p>
What do we do
<br>
when these human
<br>
forms fail
<br>
to express?
<br>
And I've forgotten
<br>
to tell my story.
</p>
