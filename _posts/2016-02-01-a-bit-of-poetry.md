###This is my very first post to my very first website!

So I thought I'd take the opportunity to share a recent poem, which is just one piece of the wonderful, creative puzzle I have been collaborating on lately. 


<div class="poem">
  <p>
*Hide & Seek*
<br>
</p>

<p>
“I’ll count down from fifty!”   
<br>
</p>

<p>
She runs.  
<br>
So quickly and with such
<br>
force that the snow
<br>
flies out behind her in great
<br>
powder waves.
<br>
So quickly that each
<br>
thud
<br>  
thUD
<br>
THUD
<br>  
of her little heart
<br>
cancels it out.
<br>
The cracking of the ice
<br>
that
<br>
slithers
<br>
beneath her.
<br>
She runs.
<br>
And so exhilarated is she
<br>
by the frigid air
<br>
and her heavy breath
<br>
it is only when
<br>
she is swallowed whole
<br>
that she realizes —
<br>
her limbs
<br>
are no longer rushing
<br>
against air,
<br>
but water instead.
<br>
She sinks lower
<br>
and lower
<br>
and
<br> 
her mouth
<br>
forms a small
<br>
“oh!”
<br>  
Mild surprise floods her,
<br>
before the darkness takes over.
<br>
She notes tendrils
<br>
of seaweed
<br>  
taking captive
<br>
her feet.  
<br>
<br>
