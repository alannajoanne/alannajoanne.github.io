###This is my very first post to my very first website!

So I thought I'd take the opportunity to share a recent poem, which is just one piece of the wonderful, creative puzzle I have been collaborating on lately.

###Hide & Seek


“I’ll count down from fifty!”   

She runs.  
So quickly and with such  
force that the snow  
flies out behind her in great  
powder waves.  
So quickly that each  
thud  
thUD  
THUD  
of her little heart  
cancels it out.  
The cracking of the ice  
that  
slithers  
beneath her.  
She runs.  
And so exhilarated is she  
by the frigid air  
and her heavy breath  
it is only when  
she is swallowed whole  
that she realizes —  
her limbs  
are no longer rushing  
against air,  
but water instead.     
She sinks lower  
and lower  
and  
her mouth  
forms a small  
“oh!”  
Mild surprise floods her,  
before the darkness takes over.  
She notes tendrils  
of seaweed  
taking captive    
her feet.
