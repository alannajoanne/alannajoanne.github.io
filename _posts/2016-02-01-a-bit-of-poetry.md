###This is my very first post to my very first website!

So I thought I'd take the opportunity to share a recent poem, which is just one piece of the wonderful, creative puzzle I have been collaborating on lately.

###Hide & Seek


“I’ll count down from fifty!”··  

She runs.··  
So quickly and with such··  
force that the snow··  
flies out behind her in great··  
powder waves.··   
So quickly that each··   
thud··   
thUD··  
THUD··   
of her little heart··  
cancels it out.··   
The cracking of the ice··  
that··  
slithers··  
beneath her.··  
She runs.··  
And so exhilarated is she··  
by the frigid air··  
and her heavy breath··  
it is only when··  
she is swallowed whole··  
that she realizes —··   
her limbs··  
are no longer rushing··   
against air,··  
but water instead.··   
She sinks lower··  
and lower··  
and··  
her mouth··   
forms a small··  
“oh!”··  
Mild surprise floods her,··  
before the darkness takes over.··  
She notes tendrils··   
of seaweed··   
taking captive··  
her feet.··
