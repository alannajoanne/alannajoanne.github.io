*VAMPIRES*
<br>
</p>

<p>
They ate our sunshine
<br>
    before turning with ravenous eyes
<br>    
      and watering mouths
<br>      
  towards our spirits. 
<br>
<br>
Vampires feeding on light and souls,
<br>
    a blood lust unprecedented. 
<br>
<br>
Was it enough to keep them satisfied?
<br>
Was it enough to keep them alive?
<br>
<br> 
  And what were we to do,
<br>
      plunged into darkness after darkness?
<br>
<br>
To run and hide was futile.
<br>
  Fugitives as we were, shackled
<br>
      to these festering human shells.
<br>
<br>
What did freedom look like?
<br>
What shape would our resistence take
<br>
    with hatred seeping into the water,
<br>
        flushing us out from the inside.
<br>
<br> 
Oil spills and infiltration.
<br>
Lies and emotional warfare.
<br>
<br>
The air is growing toxic.
<br>
<br>
But can there be darkness, truly,
<br>
  or soullessness
<br>  
  without the light.
<br>
<br>
Without us.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps our revolution is to live
<br>
    rather than simply, complacently
<br>
  exist.
