*PURPLE MOONS*
<br>
</p>  
<P>
Two moons
<br>
same phase â€”
<br>
waxing gibbous
<br>
in a haze.
</P>

<p>
Shrouded.
</p>

<p>
Purple skies.
<br>
Bruised clouds.
<br>
Dark trees.
</p>

<p>
What do you
<br>
mean?
</p>

<p>
Side by side
<br>
does the Wolf
<br>
howl, or is it
<br>
me?
</p>

<p>
Skipping beats
<br>
or hearts
<br>
under the sky
<br>
in twilight.
</p>

<p>
A light,
<br>
a Dream.
</p>

<p>
Shrouded.
</p>

<p>
Two moons,
<br>
same phase.
</p>
