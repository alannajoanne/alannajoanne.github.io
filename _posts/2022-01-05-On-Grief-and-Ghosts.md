*ON GRIEF AND GHOSTS*
<br>
<em>written 24/11/2021</em>
</p>  
<P>
In this clan
<br>
it is the Women
<br>
left standing.
</P>

<p>
Our hearts forced
<br>
open, stretched
<br>
and stengthened
<br>
to make room
<br>
for it all.
</p>

<p>
To bear it all â€”
<br>
the weight of
<br>
this world;
<br>
the love for
<br>
the Earth.
</p>

<p>
Mothers.
<br>
Daughters.
</p>

<p>
Death and
<br>
birth.
</p>

<p>
Biting back
<br>
both tears
<br>
and laughter.
</p>

<p>
Our shoulders,
<br>
bones petite,
<br>
squared against
<br>
the oncoming blaze.
<br>
One step forward
<br>
repeat.
</p>

<p>
Bearing children
<br>
and pain.
<br>
Time and again.
</p>

<p>
And the men
<br>
trail behind.
</p>

<p>
Ghosts and wraiths.
</p>

<p>
In this clan
<br>
it is the Women
<br>
</p>

<p>
And I wonder
<br>
when the Universe
<br>
will cease to be
<br>
so demanding.
</p>
