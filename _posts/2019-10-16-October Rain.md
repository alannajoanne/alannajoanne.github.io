<div class="poem">
<P>
October rain showering me
<br>
with visions of a time before.
</P>

<p>
Candy coloured reflections in
<br>
deep, inky pools.
</p>

<p>
I loved you once, when the world
<br>
looked like this.
</p>

<p>
When the scent of Fall was
<br>
falling in loved.
</p>

<p>
And softly drifting leaves,
<br>
your fingertips.
</p>

<p>
Tentative and changing.
</p>

<br>
