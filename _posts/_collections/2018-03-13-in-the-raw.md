*IN THE RAW*
<br>
</p>

<p>
Remember when "faux"
<br>
was in fashion?
<br>
—— see faux fur
<br>
and faux pas. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Before truth
<br>
was our passion; 
<br>
to see it return
<br>
and the lies withdrawn.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Because now "to know"
<br>
has been challenged
<br>
—— in our homes
<br>
and in our laws.
</p>
<br>
<p>
With these foes
<br>
leaning forward
<br>
reality broken
<br>
in their jaws.
</p>
<br>
<p>
And so "to be"
<br>
becomes pas sûr:
<br>
Uncertainty,
<br>
in the raw.
</p>
<br>
<p>
But just like sugar
<br>
we may be burned, though not broken.
<br> 
Hear the people's outcry:
<br>
"Faugh!"
</p>
