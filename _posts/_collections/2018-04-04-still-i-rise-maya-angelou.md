<div class="poem">
  <p>
*STILL I RISE*
<br>
</p>

<p>
You may write me down in history
<br>
With your bitter, twisted lies,
<br>
You may trod me in the very dirt
<br>
But still, like dust, I'll rise. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Does my sassiness upset you?
<br>
Why are you beset with gloom? 
<br>
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
<br>
Pumping in my living room.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Just like moons and like suns,
<br>
With the certainty of tides,
<br>
Just like hopes springing high,
<br>
Still I'll rise.
</p>

<br>
