<div class="poem">
<P>
There are moments
<br>
when I don't know
<br>
if what I need is
<br>
plants or planets
<br>
â€” deep space
<br>
or green space.
<br>
Either way,
<br>
an escape.
<br>
From the chaos
<br>
of this concrete
<br>
jungle.
<p>


<p>
If there must be
<br>
dust, then let it
<br>
sparkle and float
<br>
between the stars
<br>
and stigmas.
</p>
