<div class="poem">
  <p>
*FROM BEYOND*
<br>
</p>

<P>
Remnants of the dead
<br>
permeate my view as I
<br>
finally wake from this centuries-slumber.
</P>

<p>
Fallen, blackened trees
<br>
and sterile Earth.
</p>

<p>
Skeletons of corporations-past.
<br>
  Their steel bones now dull
  <br>
            and rusted.
        </p>

<p>
Their hearts too.
</p>

<p>
And the sky is on fire.
</p>
