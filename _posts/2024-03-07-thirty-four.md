*THIRTY-FOUR*
<br>
<em>written 07/03/2024</em>
</p>  
<P>
I'm on the cusp of 34
<br>
and I'm not sure what
<br>
I miss mmore...
</br>
The sound of your voice,
</br>
or the sunwarmed spot
</br>
of my childhood bedroom floor.
</P>

<p>
But they're both entangled
<br>
I suppose.
<br>
Moments in time that
<br>
only my memory
<br>
really knows.
</p>

<p>
The chasm of Time
<br>
stretches wider.
<br>
And the ache in my
<br>
chest grows tired.
<br>
The rage in my belly
</br>
like fire.
</p>

<p>
This is the paradigm of
<br>
Womanhood.
</p>

<p>
Shrouded in a sea 
<br>
of "could"s and "would"s
</br>
and "should"s.
</p>

<p>
And caged in the tempest's
<br>
centre: my Girlhood.
</p>

<p>
We carry the world
<br>
in our wombs.
<br>
Our evolution both too far
<br>
away, and too soon.
</p>

<p>
Our bodies claimed by men
<br>
and a beguiling moon.
</p>

<p>
So what does 34 mean
<br>
in consideration of
</br>
the grand Scheme?
</p>

<p>
Merely a glimmer.
</br>
A lament.
</br>
A dream.
</p>
