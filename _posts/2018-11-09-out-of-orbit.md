  <p>
*OUT OF ORBIT*
<br>
</p>

<P>
I don't care for holding the world
<br>
anymore; this cold and
<br>
hardened sphere.
</P>

<p>
For to hold it up, to hold
<br>
it dear,
<br>
has burned our souls.
<br>
And hardened hearts
<br>
with fear.
</p>

<p>
The colour of jade.
<br>
The colour of soot.
<br>
Anger poisons our blood
<br>
from head,
<br>
to foot.
</p>

<p>
And what is there for show for it?
<br>
From holding this globe
<br>
up in helpless orbit.
</p>

<p>
Would gravity pull
<br>
it down?
<br>
Would the antithesis
<br>
pull it away?
<br>
I no longer care
<br>
for its awful weight.
</p>

<P>
I don't care for holding the world
<br>
anymore; this cold and
<br>
hardened sphere.
</P>
