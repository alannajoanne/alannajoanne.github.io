        <title>A little bit of poetry</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-is-my-very-first-post-to-my-very-first-website&quot;&gt;This is my very first post to my very first website!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought I’d take the opportunity to share a recent poem, which is just one piece of the wonderful, creative puzzle I have been collaborating on lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hide--seek&quot;&gt;Hide &amp;amp; Seek&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’ll count down from fifty!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She runs. 
So quickly and with such
force that the snow 
flies out behind her in great
powder waves. 
So quickly that each 
thud 
thUD
THUD 
of her little heart
cancels it out. 
The cracking of the ice
that
slithers
beneath her.
She runs.
And so exhilarated is she
by the frigid air
and her heavy breath
it is only when
she is swallowed whole
that she realizes — 
her limbs
are no longer rushing 
against air,
but water instead. 
She sinks lower
and lower
and
her mouth 
forms a small
“oh!”
Mild surprise floods her,
before the darkness takes over.
She notes tendrils 
of seaweed 
taking captive
her feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🐚🌱&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasonhargrove&quot;&gt;@jasonhargrove&lt;/a&gt; for editing with patience.&lt;/p&gt;
